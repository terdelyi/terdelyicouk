            <p>I was about ten when I first met with a real computer: it was our neighbour's Commodore 64.
                I was so excited that my dad had to buy one for us. I liked games, but I more liked the fact I can make
                the computer to ask some input from me then output them differently on the screen.
                A few years later my parents enrolled me in a course where I learned how to use Windows 3.1 professionally
                and how to code in Basic. I'm not saying I was a kid genius, but my interest in computers was very
                obvious from an early age. I was already deeply in love with movies, but computers seemed to be
                my new passion.</p>
            <p>
                I built my first PC mainly to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/terdelyi/love-declaration?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing">write songs with Fast Tracker 2</a>,
                but it also helped me to manage my massive VHS catalog. Then I become a big fan of diskmags. I ripped apart their
                compiled codebase to see how they worked. I already wrote a few Basic programs by that time, but it was just a hobby. Over
                the years, I learned about Turbo Pascal, Perl, and became very familiar with mot CorelDRAW products and
                Paint Shop Pro.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then came the internet. I started coding websites for Netscape Navigator through a dial-up modem
                with FrontPage Express, using the earliest versions of HTML and CSS. In my twenties, <a src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304123336/http://www.moziplussz.hu/">I launched a portal about movies</a>
                and began to make websites for different size of businesses.

                <div class="text-sm text-neutral-300 dark:text-blue-200 text-center">My desktop setups between 2009 and 2020</div>
            </div>
            <p>In 2005, I needed something more permanent, so I was building websites using TYPO3 and PHP 5. Years later, I grew tired of agency projects,
                I tried myself a freelancer, but I had no real strategy. After two challenging years, rent and bills eventually won, and I lost my independence.
                Since 2013 I have been an employee until massive lay-off waves in 2023 finally reached me. In the last decade, I have worked for small agencies
                and even large corporate machines. Nowadays, I'm freelancing, contracting and working on my own ideas.</p>
            <p>
                I have been building websites and web applications for <?php echo $experienceInYears; ?> years now. I started as a web designer,
                but found myself more efficient in site-building, and in the end I learned how to become a proficient PHP developer. I find myself more satisfied
                with backend programming, but things like Tailwind and VueJS drew my attention back to frontend for a bit. I met JAMstack, tried myself in mobile
                development and gained some necessary devops knowledge. My curiosity knows no boundaries.
            </p>
            <p>I was born and raised in Budapest, Hungary, but I moved to England in 2017 and restarted
                climbing the career ladder from the bottom. In just five years, I have achieved most goals
                I have imagined in my career.</p>
            <p>Although I've worked mainly in web development in the past two decades, I consider myself an open-minded
                software developer, eager to learn and explore everything that advances my experience and keeps my
                brain engaged. I've been working from my home office since COVID-19, but I frequently appear in a local meetup or spend the day in a co-working space.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I'm a geek dad in his 40s who collects records and love to spend
                time in the nature. I'm somewhere between an introverted and extroverted person, but I'm always ready
                to travel and immerse new cultures.</p>
