                    <p>Switched from a 13" MacBook Pro 2017 which was clearly the worst machine I've ever bought from Apple.
                        The M1 Air is absolutely the opposite: fast, lightweight and perfect for an everyday home computer.</p>

                    <p>After 9 years with Dell U2715H I recently switched to widescreen for higher performance. I was never be a fan of
                        using two monitors, but I also needed something higher than 27", but there are no Mac compatible, high PPI monitors on
                        the market right now. But this one is 120Hz, has KVM and works perfectly with both Mac and PC.</p>

                    <h4>Keychron K1 Bluetooth Mechanical Keyboard</h4>
                    <p>I jumped on the mechanic keyboard train after using Apple keyboards for a decade. It has shiny RGB
                        lights which looks cool, but I barely turn them on and sadly the batteries aren't the best in
                        the category. Although cleaning is a nightmare.</p>

                    <p>I only looked away once from the Magic Mouse to try an MX Master, and absolutely loved it! It's more ergonomic
                        and I just love the endless scrolling wheel.

                        I also have a Sony WH‑1000XM3, just in case I need some punchy bass.

                    <h4>Autonomous SmartDesk 2 DIY standing frame</h4>
                    <p>I'm not an avid user of standing desks, but it's good to have an option to switch postures. I have three
                        heights set: sitting, standing, and "making music" which is somewhere in the middle. I skipped the top,
                        because that's overpriced.

                    <h4>IKEA Övraryd table-top, bamboo, 150x78</h4>
                    <p>It's originally a dining table-top from IKEA, but I drilled it to the Autonomous frame. I love desks
                        with more depth, and having a decent space for all of my stuff.

                    <h4>Xiaomi Monitor Light bar</h4>
                    <p>People had been talking about it in the office, and I finally gave it a go after a few months. Immediately dropped
                        my desk lamp and saved more space. It's hard to find the best position on the top of the monitor when
                        you also have a webcam, but the remote control is very cool.</p>

                    <h4>PHPStorm</h4>
                    <p>The best IDE for PHP and web development: it has a client for everything from Git conflicts through Docker and databases. I'm

                    <h4>KRK Rokit 5 G4 White Noise</h4>
                    <p>They're brilliant active monitor speakers with good enough bass for a small room. After two years I
                        bought a standing desk clamp for both, now they're using less space on my desk and positioned to the
                        same height where my ears are.</p>

                    <h4>Ableton Live 10</h4>
                    <p>A bit far from Fast Tracker 2 which I have grown up in my childhood. I've tried Logic and Fruity Loops, but
                        nothing beats the layout and the possibilities with Live.

                    <p>Great for writing songs with loops, doing live acts and DJing. And it's also a perfect match for
                        Ableton Live.

                    <p>Awesome little tool for producing music and playing with VSTis. Sometimes I miss more keys, but the
                        fact it fits in your backpack is unbeatable.

                    <p>It is my first and now legacy MIDI keyboard. I almost sold it, but the knobs and triggers do feel very
                        real.

                    <h4>Audio-Technica ATH-M50X</h4>
                    <p>Wireless isn't good enough for mixing when you need instant feedback. However, be careful with the
                        volume: it's really crisp and very loud! The only downside is that I have to replace the ear pads every
                        two or three years.
