            <div class="md:w-1/2 md:pr-6">
                <h4>MacBook Air (13-inch, 2021, 2.3 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5, 16 GB, 512 GB SSD)</h4>
                <div class="text-base/7 mb-8">Switched from a 13" MacBook Pro 2017 which was clearly the worst machine I've ever bought from Apple.
                    The M1 Air is absolutely the opposite: fast, lightweight and perfect for an everyday home computer.</div>
                <h4>Dell U3225WE</h4>
                <div class="text-base/7 mb-8">After 9 years with Dell U2715H I recently switched to widescreen for higher performance. I was never be a fan of
                    using two monitors, but I also needed something higher than 27", but there are no Mac compatible, high PPI monitors on
                    the market right now. But this one is 120Hz, has KVM and works perfectly with both Mac and PC.</div>
                <h4>Keychron K1 Bluetooth Mechanical Keyboard</h4>
                <div class="text-base/7 mb-8">I jumped on the mechanic keyboard train after using Apple keyboards for a decade. It has shiny RGB
                    lights which looks cool, but I barely turn them on and sadly the batteries aren't the best in
                    the category. Although cleaning is a nightmare.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="md:w-1/2 md:pl-6">
                <h4>Logitech MX Master 3</h4>
                <div class="text-base/7 mb-8">I only looked away once from the Magic Mouse to try an MX Master, and absolutely loved it! It's more ergonomic
                    and I just love the endless scrolling wheel.
                </div>
                <h4>Logitech c920 HD Pro</h4>
                <div class="text-base/7 mb-8">Great for HD conferences, but less ideal for YouTube content creation.</div>
                <h4>AirPods Pro</h4>
                <div class="text-base/7 mb-8">The first AirPods which fits in my ear. Very comfy, sounds nice and it's charging fast.
                    I also have a Sony WH‑1000XM3, just in case I need some punchy bass.
                </div>
                <h4>Apple iPhone 12 - (PRODUCT)Red</h4>
                <div class="text-base/7 mb-8">I'm a loyal iPhone user since the 3GS.</div>

                <h4>Autonomous SmartDesk 2 DIY standing frame</h4>
                <div class="text-base/7 mb-8">I'm not an avid user of standing desks, but it's good to have an option to switch postures. I have three
                    heights set: sitting, standing, and "making music" which is somewhere in the middle. I skipped the top,
                    because that's overpriced.
                </div>
                <h4>IKEA Övraryd table-top, bamboo, 150x78</h4>
                <div class="text-base/7 mb-8">It's originally a dining table-top from IKEA, but I drilled it to the Autonomous frame. I love desks
                    with more depth, and having a decent space for all of my stuff.
                </div>

                <h4>Xiaomi Monitor Light bar</h4>
                <div class="text-base/7 mb-8">People had been talking about it in the office, and I finally gave it a go after a few months. Immediately dropped
                    my desk lamp and saved more space. It's hard to find the best position on the top of the monitor when
                    you also have a webcam, but the remote control is very cool.</div>

                <h4>PHPStorm</h4>
                <div class="text-base/7 mb-8">The best IDE for PHP and web development: it has a client for everything from Git conflicts through Docker and databases. I'm
                    intentionally <a href="https://stitcher.io/blog/why-light-themes-are-better-according-to-science">using it with a light theme</a>.

                <h4>Presonus ERIS 3.5 2nd Gen</h4>
                <div class="text-base/7 mb-8">I switched a pair of KRK Rokit 5 G4 White Noise to these after one of the speakers unexpectedly died and even the manufacturer couldn't help me to fix it.
                    They look like cheap PC speakers, and not flat enough for reference monitors, but it was a bargain, and 50W is more than enough in my small office.</div>
                <h4>Ableton Live 10</h4>
                <div class="text-base/7 mb-8">A bit far from Fast Tracker 2 which I have grown up in my childhood. I've tried Logic and Fruity Loops, but
                    nothing beats the layout and the possibilities with Live.
                </div>
                <h4>XENYX 302 USB</h4>
                <div class="text-base/7 mb-8">I needed something to route my CD player, the record player and my computer's soundcard together, so I bought this cheap mixer which does the job perfectly.</div>
                <h4>Akai APC40 mkII</h4>
                <div class="text-base/7 mb-8">Great for writing songs with loops, doing live acts and DJing. And it's also a perfect match for
                    Ableton Live.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="md:w-1/2 md:pl-6">
                <h4>Akai MPK Mini mkII</h4>
                <div class="text-base/7 mb-8">Awesome little tool for producing music and playing with VSTis. Sometimes I miss more keys, but the
                    fact it fits in your backpack is unbeatable.
                </div>
                <h4>EMU Xboard 25</h4>
                <div class="text-base/7 mb-8">It is my first and now legacy MIDI keyboard. I almost sold it, but the knobs and triggers do feel very
                    real.
                </div>
                <h4>Blue Yeti</h4>
                <div class="text-base/7 mb-8">It's a good microphone, but not for podcasting as it records every tiny details in the background.
                </div>
                <h4>Audio-Technica ATH-M50X</h4>
                <div class="text-base/7 mb-8">Wireless isn't good enough for mixing when you need instant feedback. However, be careful with the
                    volume: it's really crisp and very loud! The only downside is that I have to replace the ear pads every
                    two or three years.
