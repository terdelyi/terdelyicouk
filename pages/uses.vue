            <p>Switched from 13" MacBook Pro 2017 which was the worst machine what I've ever had from Apple. The M1 Air is exactly the opposite: fast, lightweight and perfect for a home computer.</p>

            <p>I jumped on the mechanic keyboard train after using Apple keyboards in the last decade. It has shiny RGB lights which looks cool, but I barely turn them on and sadly the battery seems to be dying in less than a year.</p>

            <p>I only looked away once to the Magic Mouse and tried an MX Master 2, and I love it! It's more ergonomic
              and I the endless scrolling is a game changer.

            <p>The first AirPods which fits in my ear. Very comfy and charging fast. I also have a Sony WH‑1000XM3 when
              I need some punchy bass.

            <p>I'm not an avid user of standing desks, but it's good to have an option to change positions. I have three
              height set: sitting, standing, and "making music" which is half between them.

              150x78</a></h4>
            <p>I switched to this (dining) table top from a Bekant 120x60 and DIY drilled to the frame. I love desks
              with larger depth, however it's not the best, but I have decent space for all of my stuff.

            <p>I was looking for a stylish LED table lamp when I found this fine product of TaoTronics. Not perfect, but
              it does the job.

            <h4><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PHPStorm</a></h4>
            <p>The best IDE for PHP and web development: it knows everything from Git through Docker to databases. I'm
              using it with light theme.

            Sublime instead.

            <p>A bit far from Fast Tracker 2 which I grown up in my childhood. I've tried Logic and Fruity Loops, but
              nothing beats the layout and the possibilities with Live.

            <p>Great for writing songs with loops, doing live acts and DJing. And it's also a perfect match for
              Ableton Live.

            <p>Awesome little tool for producing music and playing with VSTis. Sometimes I miss more keys, but the
              fact it fits in your backpack is unbeatable.

            <p>It is my first and now legacy MIDI keyboard. I almost sold it, but the knobs and triggers do feel very
              real.

            <h4><a href="https://amzn.to/3mG77N9">Blue Yeti</a></h4>
            <p>It's a good microphone, but not for podcasting as it records every tiny details in the background.

            <h4><a href="https://amzn.to/2VHaFmp">Audio-Technica ATH-M50X</a></h4>
            <p>Wireless isn't good enough for mixing when you need instant feedback. However be careful with the
              volume: it's really crisp and very loud!
