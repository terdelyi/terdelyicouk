            <p>Switched from a 13" MacBook Pro 2017 which was clearly the worst machine I've ever bought from Apple.
              The M1 Air is absolutely the opposite: fast, lightweight and perfect for an everyday home computer.</p>

            <p>I jumped on the mechanic keyboard train after using Apple keyboards for a decade. It has shiny RGB
              lights which looks cool, but I barely turn them on and sadly the batteries aren't the best in
              the category.</p>

            <p>I only looked away once from the Magic Mouse to try an MX Master, and absolutely loved it! It's more ergonomic
              and I just love the endless scrolling wheel.

            <p>The first AirPods which fits in my ear. Very comfy, sounds nice and it's charging fast.
              I also have a Sony WH‑1000XM3, just in case I need some punchy bass.

            <h4><a href="https://bit.ly/2X3C0zX">Autonomous SmartDesk 2 DIY standing frame</a></h4>
            <p>I'm not an avid user of standing desks, but it's good to have an option to switch postures. I have three
              heights set: sitting, standing, and "making music" which is somewhere in the middle. I skipped the top,
              because that's overpriced.

            <p>It's originally a dining table top from IKEA, but I drilled it to the Autonomous frame. I love desks
              with more depth, and having a decent space for all of my stuff.

            <h4><a href="https://www.mi.com/uk/product/mi-computer-monitor-light-bar/">Xiaomi Monitor Light bar</a></h4>
            <p>People had been talking about it in the office, and I finally gave it a go after a few months. Immediately dropped
              my desk lamp and saved more space. It's hard to find the best position on the top of the monitor when
              you also have a webcam, but the remote control is very cool.</p>

            <h4><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PHPStorm</a></h4>
            <p>The best IDE for PHP and web development: it has a client for everything from Git conflicts through Docker and databases. I'm
              intentionally <a href="https://stitcher.io/blog/why-light-themes-are-better-according-to-science">using it with a light theme</a>.

            <p>They're brilliant active monitor speakers with good enough bass for a small room. After two years I
              bought a standing desk clamp for both, now they're using less space on my desk and positioned to the
              same height where my ears are.</p>

            <h4><a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/live/">Ableton Live</a></h4>
            <p>A bit far from Fast Tracker 2 which I grown up in my childhood. I've tried Logic and Fruity Loops, but
              nothing beats the layout and the possibilities with Live.

            <h4><a href="https://amzn.to/2JPHNG8">Akai APC40 mkII</a></h4>
            <p>Great for writing songs with loops, doing live acts and DJing. And it's also a perfect match for
              Ableton Live.
            </p>

            <h4><a href="https://amzn.to/3gdMUfk">Akai MPK Mini mkII</a></h4>
            <p>Awesome little tool for producing music and playing with VSTis. Sometimes I miss more keys, but the
              fact it fits in your backpack is unbeatable.

            <h4><a href="https://amzn.to/2VEkfGN">EMU Xboard 25</a></h4>
            <p>It is my first and now legacy MIDI keyboard. I almost sold it, but the knobs and triggers do feel very
              real.

            <h4><a href="https://amzn.to/3mG77N9">Blue Yeti</a></h4>
            <p>It's a good microphone, but not for podcasting as it records every tiny details in the background.

          <div>
            <h4><a href="https://amzn.to/2VHaFmp">Audio-Technica ATH-M50X</a></h4>
            <p>Wireless isn't good enough for mixing when you need instant feedback. However be careful with the
              volume: it's really crisp and very loud! The only downside is that I have to replace the ear pads every
              two or three years.
