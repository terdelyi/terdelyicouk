You're looking at the source code of my personal website.

I'm a software developer, specialised in web-related services. If you'd like to contact me,
please [use this form](https://terdelyi.co.uk/contact/).

## Development

The site is using an open-source static site generator of mine called
[Phanstatic](https://github.com/terdelyi/phanstatic/).

### Install

To be able to build the site locally you need PHP 8.3 and Node 23.

```
composer install
npm install
npm run build
```

### Disclaimer

Get inspired, but don't copy the design or the content of this site directly.
If you re-use the code or any element drop me a DM, I would be happy to hear about it!
